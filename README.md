Redirect Mabinogi Launcher - Mark 2
===================================

Description
-----------

This launcher is built to support most function a Mabinogi private server might want.  
Some parts of this launcher are based off of Logue's MabiLauncher (<a href="https://github.com/logue/MabiLauncher">https://github.com/logue/MabiLauncher</a>)  
For the most part I used Logue's source to figure out how the official stuff worked.  

Features
--------
 
* Launching the client  
* Self updater for the launcher  
* Client updater that works off the official update servers  
* Reading of a remote patch info file  
* Automatic downloading of a modpack package file for a specific server  
* Launcher web page like the official launcher
* Adding and modifying servers, including overriding some info from the patchdata file.  

Usage
-----

The launcher can be used either standalone or distributed by a host with a server preconfigured.  
If you wish to use the launcher standalone you can simply download and run it, it comes with the NA server preset.  
Also adding more servers is simple, just enter options and hit add.

If you wish to distribute preconfigured versions and setup the extra functionality of the launcher please see the wiki.

Misc
----

Inside the options you also have the possibility to launch the Kanan patcher (<a href="https://github.com/cursey/kanan">https://github.com/cursey/kanan</a>) automatically when launching Mabinogi.  
The launcher has only been tested for the North American patch servers and client, code may need tweaking for other regions, fill an issue about it and I'll try to get it working.
